# Python Data Types, Structures, and DSA Practice

This repository contains theory and practical questions on **Python data types**, **data structures**, and some **basic DSA problems**. It is a great resource for beginners and intermediates preparing for coding interviews or improving Python proficiency.

## ðŸ“š Contents

### ðŸ”¹ Theory Questions
- What are Data Structures and why are they important?
- Mutable vs Immutable Data Types (with examples)
- Lists vs Tuples
- Dictionaries and Data Storage
- Use of Sets over Lists
- Strings vs Lists
- Tuples and Data Integrity
- Hash Tables and Python Dictionaries
- Heterogeneous Data in Lists
- Why Strings are Immutable
- Dictionary vs List (Advantages)
- Handling Duplicates in Sets
- When to Use Tuples over Lists
- "in" Keyword in Lists vs Dictionaries
- Modifiability of Tuples
- Nested Dictionaries (Use Case)
- Dictionary Access Time Complexity
- When Lists are Preferred over Dictionaries
- Dictionaries and Order
- List vs Dictionary: Data Retrieval

### ðŸ”¹ Practical Coding Problems
- String operations (slicing, uppercase, replacement, etc.)
- List operations (creation, append, remove, reverse, etc.)
- Tuple operations (accessing elements, finding min/index, etc.)
- Set operations (creation, union, intersection, clear, etc.)
- Dictionary operations (creation, update, key-value access, merge)
- Random number generation and sorting

### ðŸ”¹ Example Snippets

```python
# Create a string and print
name = "Sachin Thakur"
print(name)

# Replace in a string
sentence = "I like apple"
print(sentence.replace("apple", "orange"))

# Union of sets
a = {1, 2, 3}
b = {3, 4, 5}
print(a.union(b))
